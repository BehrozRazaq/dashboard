# Media Ops Dashboard (TUI)

A dense, cozy, muted-purple terminal dashboard for:

- Sonarr, Radarr, Plex, Home Assistant, Prowlarr uptime (HTTP availability uptime)
- Ongoing torrents from qBittorrent
- Local Windows host metrics (CPU, memory, network)

Built with `textual` + `rich` + `asyncio`, using `psutil` and `httpx`.

## Visual style

- Muted purple palette with soft, low-glare text
- Dense pro dashboard layout for fast scanning
- Smooth transitions on metric and progress changes
- Motion mode toggle: `normal` / `reduced` / `off`

## Setup

1. Create and activate a Python 3.10+ environment.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values.
4. Run:

```bash
python -m dashboard.main
```

or:

```bash
dashboard
```

## Controls

- `q`: quit
- `r`: manual refresh
- `m`: cycle motion mode (`normal` → `reduced` → `off`)

## Notes

- Uptime is based on successful HTTP/API reachability duration.
- If a service is down, the app shows degraded/down state without stopping.
- Home Assistant is monitored as an application endpoint only.
